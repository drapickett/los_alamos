html is always read sequentially, from top to bottom. be sure to close nested tags before parent tags. meta info doesn't need to be closed - it is only read by the browser. lastly, when specifying document type - if this is not done, the page will be read in quirks mode and problems can arise. (no space between the exclamation point and the word doctype, which, btw, can be upper or lowercase!)
