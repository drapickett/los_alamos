Does the section title region always appear in the top right corner of the section region, no matter what view is being displayed (desktop, tablet, or mobile)?

Is there consistent horizontal spacing between the section regions and browser edges (especially in the desktop and tablet views) and consistent vertical spacing between the regions (especially in the tablet and mobile views)?

Is there padding separating the dummy text from the edges of the section? Is the dummy text pushed down such that it doesn’t overlap the section title region?

Are the borders and colors implemented according the stated requirements?

<h2>Modified Sushi</h2>
	<p>Sushi doesn't have to contain fish! Although many people love eating tuna (toro), it has been overfished to astonishing levels and is listed as "endangered" by the Center for Biological Diversity. Sweet potatoes, avocado, tofu, and even kimchi make delicious rolls, too!</p>
